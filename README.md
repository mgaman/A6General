# A6General
A general purpose library for the Arduino A6GPRS user. THe first issue implements the MQTT protocol. More to come.
The library is configurable to work on any hardware serial port (Serial, Serial1, Serial2, Serial3). It will NOT work on SoftwareSerial.
Other configurations are for the size of the UART buffer and expected maximum size of Topic+Message received.

More classes are on the way e.g. HTTP, SMTP, SMS, CALL
